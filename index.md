Welcome

<!--
I'm a PhD student in computational neuroscience and neuromorphic engineering at both [INM-6](https://www.fz-juelich.de/inm/inm-6/EN/Home/home_node_INM6.html) and [PGI-7](https://www.fz-juelich.de/pgi/pgi-7/EN/Home/home_node.html), Research Centre Jülich, Germany.

I'm a PhD student in computational neuroscience and neuromorphic engineering at the [Research Centre Jülich, Germany](https://www.fz-juelich.de/portal/EN/Home/home_node.html). 

Previously, I graduated from the [nanotech program](https://nanotech.grenoble-inp.fr/) with a Master's Degree in Micro and Nano Technologies for Integrated Systems. 

My research strives to unveil the neural mechanisms underpinning computation in the brain and exploit this knowledge to build highly efficient computers. 
In our research program, we aim at addressing these questions following a multidisciplinary approach with three main steps:
* Investigate brain's computational mechanisms and principles using knowledge from biology
* Develop models using methods from physics and computer science and test these using computer simulations
* Map these models directly on a hardware substrate, e.g., brain-inspired (neuromorphic) computers
