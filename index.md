Welcome

I'm a PhD student in computational neuroscience and neuromorphic engineering at the JÃ¼lich research center in Germany. My research strives to unveil the neural mechanisms underpinning computation in the brain and exploit this knowledge to build highly efficient computers. Throughout this endeavour, I follow a multidisciplinary approach combining methods and knowledge from neuroscience, computer science, physics, and material science.

Brains excel at a wide range of computations. They outperform conventional computers at many aspects, they are very energy efficient, have a higher capacity to generalize, and can learn from small training examples. Moreover, they compute robustly even in a highly changing environment using intricate biological mechanisms and principles. It's arguable that a better grasp of these mechanisms is crucial for furthering our understanding of intelligent systems and a source of inspiration to advance computers. In our research program, we aim at addressing these questions relying on three consecutive steps:

* Investigate these computational mechanisms and principles using knowledge from biology
* Develop models using methods from physics and computer science and test these using computer simulations
* Map these models directly on a hardware substrate, e.g., brain-inspired (neuromorphic) computers
