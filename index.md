Welcome

I'm a PhD student in computational neuroscience and neuromorphic engineering at both [INM-6](https://www.fz-juelich.de/inm/inm-6/EN/Home/home_node_INM6.html) and [PGI-7](https://www.fz-juelich.de/pgi/pgi-7/EN/Home/home_node.html), Research Centre JÃ¼lich, Germany. 
Previously, I graduated from the [nanotech program](https://nanotech.grenoble-inp.fr/) with a Master's Degree in Micro and Nano Technologies for Integrated Systems. 

My research strives to unveil the neural mechanisms underpinning computation in the brain and exploit this knowledge to build highly efficient computers. 
It's known that brains outperform conventional computing systems and deep learning algorithms at many aspects: they are very energy efficient, have a higher capacity to generalize, can learn from small training examples, and can operate in highly changing environments.
To achieve this performance, it uses intricate biological mechanisms and principles.
It's arguable that a better grasp of these mechanisms is crucial for furthering our understanding of intelligent systems and a source of inspiration to advance computers. 

In our research program, we aim at addressing these questions following a multidisciplinary approach with three main steps:
* Investigate brain's computational mechanisms and principles using knowledge from biology
* Develop models using methods from physics and computer science and test these using computer simulations
* Map these models directly on a hardware substrate, e.g., brain-inspired (neuromorphic) computers
