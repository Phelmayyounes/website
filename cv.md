# Work

* Research assistant, Juelich research center
  * Developed a model for sequence learning, prediction, and generation in networks of spiking neurons
  * Studying probabilistic sequence processing in networks of spiking neurons
  * Studying the functional aspects of memristive devices in neuromorphic computing

* Research intern, IBM Almaden Research Center
  * Developed and implemented a memory-augmented neural network model inspired by the human working memory
  * Implemented psychometric tests designed for human working memory and applied to our artificial model, which showed superior perfor-
mance compared to the state-of-the-art (i.e. LSTM, Differentiable Neural Computer)
  * Implemented machine learning models for visual question answering (VQA)
  * Designed and implemented a machine learning framework: https://github.com/IBM/mi-prometheus

* Research intern, IBM T. J. Watson Research Center
  * Developed a custom software for operating a novel optical sensor, processing the data and applying fitting routines for noise removal.
